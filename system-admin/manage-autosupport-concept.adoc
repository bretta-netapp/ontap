AutoSupport is a mechanism that proactively monitors the health of your system and automatically sends messages to NetApp technical support, your internal support organization, and a support partner. Although AutoSupport messages to technical support are enabled by default, you must set the correct options and have a valid mail host to have messages sent to your internal support organization.

AutoSupport allows many key capabilities. They include:
- Proactively opening support cases when critical issues are detected
- Filling out your Active IQ Digital Advisor and BlueXP Digital Advisor dashboards allowing you to remotely monitor your entire fleet of storage
- Health Check your storage systems to audit whether you are following best practices; giving advice on how to fix issues
- Security checks and advice on remediating any issues found
- Plan storage OS and firmware upgrades

Only the cluster administrator can perform AutoSupport management. The storage virtual machine (SVM) administrator has no access to AutoSupport.

AutoSupport is enabled by default when you configure your storage system for the first time, but may need you to allow the encrypted outbound network to reach NetApp by opening SSL port 443 outbound. AutoSupport begins sending messages to technical support 24 hours after AutoSupport is enabled. You can shorten the 24-hour period by upgrading or reverting the system, modifying the AutoSupport configuration, or changing the system time to be something other than a 24-hour period.

[NOTE]
====
You can disable AutoSupport at any time, but you should leave it enabled. Enabling AutoSupport can significantly help speed problem determination and resolution should a problem occur on your storage system (an average reduciton of 50% in time resolving support cases). By default, the system collects AutoSupport information and stores it locally, even if you disable AutoSupport.
