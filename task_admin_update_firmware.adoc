With System Manager, you can apply a firmware update to supported devices in your cluster, such as disks, disk shelves, the service processor (SP), or the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).

== Prepare for firmware update

To prepare for a smooth firmware update, you should reboot the SP or BMC before the update begins.

.Step

. Reboot the SP or BMC prior to the update: `system service-processor reboot-sp -node node_name`

== Update firmware manually

.About this task

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can receive alerts from Active IQ that inform you when firmware updates are pending on the cluster.  Then, you can download the firmware image and upload it using System Manager.

=== View firmware update alerts from Active IQ

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can receive alerts in System Manager from Active IQ Unified Manager that inform you when firmware updates are pending on the cluster.

NOTE: When working with ONTAP 9.9.1, to receive alerts about firmware updates, you must be registered with Active IQ Unified Manager. Refer to link:https://netapp.com/support-and-training/documentation/active-iq-unified-manager[Active IQ Unified Manager documentation resources^].

.Steps

. Go to *Dashboard*.
+
In the *Health* section, a message displays if there are any recommended firmware updates for the cluster.

. Click on the alert message.
+
The *Firmware Update* tab is displayed in the *Update* page.

=== Download the cluster firmware

NOTE: For ONTAP 9.8, you must navigate to the NetApp Support Site to download an updated firmware image package.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, you can use System Manager to download firmware updates from the *Update* page when you view firmware alerts (see <<View firmware update alerts from Active IQ>>.).

.Steps

Perform the procedure that is appropriate for the version of ONTAP that is installed on the cluster.

NOTE: You can monitor or verify updates under *Firmware Update Summary*. Updates that were dismissed or failed to install can be viewed in System Manager.  Go to *Cluster > Settings > Automatic Update > View All Automatic Updates*.

== Update firmware automatically

Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, you can use System Manager to enable the Automatic Update feature, which allows ONTAP to automatically download and install recommended firmware patches, upgrades, and updates provided by NetApp (the default behavior).

.Before you begin

You must have an active paid support contract. Warranty and Extended Warranty will not have this feature.

You can learn more about entitlements and which ones you have at link:./system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[Manage licenses overview (cluster administrators only)].

The Automatic Update feature requires AutoSupport connectivity over HTTPS.  To troubleshoot connectivity problems, see link:./system-admin/troubleshoot-autosupport-http-https-task.html[Troubleshoot AutoSupport message delivery over HTTP or HTTPS].

.About this task

Updates include firmware patches, upgrades, and updates for the following categories:

*	*Storage firmware*:  Storage devices, disks, and disk shelves
*	*SP/BMC firmware*:  Service processors and BMC modules

In System Manager, you can change the default behavior per category so that you receive recommendations for updates to firmware, allowing you to decide which ones to install and to set the schedule when you want them to install.  You can also turn off the feature.

To schedule updates to occur automatically and to receive recommendations about updating, you perform the following workflow tasks:

image:../media/sm-firmware-auto-update.gif[Automatic update workflow]

=== Ensure the Automatic Update feature is enabled

In System Manager, to enable the Automatic Update feature, you must accept the terms and conditions specified by NetApp.

.Before you begin

The Automatic Update feature requires that AutoSupport is enabled and using the HTTPS protocol.

.Steps

.	In System Manager, click *Events*.

.	In the *Overview* section, under *Recommended Actions*, click *Action* next to *Enable automatic update*.

.	Click *Enable*.
+
Information is displayed about the Automatic Update feature.   It describes the default behavior (automatically download and install updates) and notifies you that you can modify the default behavior.   The information also contains terms and conditions to which you must agree if you want to use this feature.

.	To accept the terms and conditions, and to enable the feature, click the checkbox, then click *Save*.

=== Specify default actions for update recommendations

ONTAP automatically detects when an update is available.  It initiates the download and installation without any intervention.  However, you can specify a different default behavior to be performed for storage firmware updates and SP/BMC firmware updates.

.Steps

.	In System Manager, click *Cluster > Settings*. 

.	In the *Automatic Update* section, click image:../media/icon_kabob.gif[make a choice] to view a list of actions.

.	Click *Edit Automatic Update Settings*.

.	Select default actions for both categories of updates.

=== Manage automatic update recommendations

In System Manager, you can view a list of recommendations and perform actions on each one or on all of them at once.

.Steps

.	Use either method to view the list of recommendations:
